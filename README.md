## installation

You can install into your application by running

You can then use it like so:

function showSimplePopup() {
  var child = document.createElement("DIV")
  child.innerHTML = `<p>This is some content that can be supplied to the popup</p>
           <p>Also press the [ESC] key to close]</p>
           <button type="submit">Clicking a submit button will also close it</button>
        `
  var popup = new SolarPopup(child)
  popup.show()
}

showSimplePopup()
```

You can also import the default styles solar-popup.css which will style it for you.

## Why

I made this popup was for my own consumption, but you are free to use it too!

## Features

- It will close on ESC press key, clicking on the close x button anchor or submit events from children
- Adds a modal background that fades in with CSS3 transitions
- Popup itself slides in with CSS3 transitions
